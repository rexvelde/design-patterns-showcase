# Design Patterns Showcase
## Preface
This project has a long term goal to use all somewhat common designpatterns, just for showcase and reference.
There are no goals, other than implement them. I may use any language I want at any time.
In the early stage of this project, I will exclusively use Kotlin, because I want to learn it.
I use the table given here https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog for my unordered list of patterns.
